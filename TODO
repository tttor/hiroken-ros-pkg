Done...
>> grasp_planner should receive information about jspace used. 
>> data path, dot paths, e.g. task graph, tmm should be in global variables set at .launch or centralized
>> adjust hiro_joint_controller.cpp to accept different jspaces
>> build object config. file + its parser
>> debug for tidying up with >= 5objects
>> geometric planning cost HAVE TO consider jspace
