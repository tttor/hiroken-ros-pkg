Done...
>> grasp_planner should receive information about jspace used. 
>> data path, dot paths, e.g. task graph, tmm should be in global variables set at .launch or centralized
>> adjust hiro_joint_controller.cpp to accept different jspaces
>> build object config. file + its parser
>> debug for tidying up with >= 5objects
>> geometric planning cost HAVE TO consider jspace
===
Notes...
whenever change hiro_arm_navigation, modify:
>> constraint_aware_kinematics.launch
  add arm_kinematic_2
>> hiro_planning_environment.launch
  <param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py '$(find hiro_common)/urdf/hiro.urdf.xacro'" />
